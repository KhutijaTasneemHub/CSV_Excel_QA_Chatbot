**Code Explanation – Line by Line**
Written by author – @KhutijaTasneemHub

1. **Importing Libraries (the tools we need)**
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

**pandas (pd):**
Helps read and work with CSV/Excel files (like a spreadsheet in Python).
Example: If you upload a marksheet, pandas lets Python read it row by row.

**streamlit (st):**
Turns this Python program into a simple web app.
Example: Instead of running code in a black terminal, Streamlit shows you a webpage where you can upload files, type questions, and see results.

**from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**

**What it does:** Breaks large text into smaller “chunks.”
**Why:** AI can’t process the whole file at once, so we give it bite-sized pieces.
**Example:** If your Excel has 1000 rows, we split them into smaller groups of 100 rows each so AI doesn’t get overwhelmed.

**from langchain_community.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings**
Embeddings = “text to numbers.”
OpenAI turns each word/sentence into a mathematical fingerprint.
This makes it possible for the computer to compare meanings.
Example: “Car” and “Vehicle” will have similar embeddings (close numbers), even though the words are different.

**from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS**
FAISS is a search engine for embeddings.
Think of it as Google inside your Excel/CSV – but instead of exact words, it searches by meaning.
Example: If your Excel has “Doctor,” and you search for “Physician,” FAISS will still find it.

**from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOpenAI**

ChatOpenAI: Lets your program talk to ChatGPT models inside Python.
load_qa_chain: A ready-made pipeline that takes:
Your question
The relevant parts of your file
Feeds it to AI
Returns an answer.

**2. Setting Up OpenAI API Key**
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

**What it does:**
Loads your secret API key from a hidden .env file.
Keeps your password safe so it’s not visible on GitHub.
Example: Think of .env as a secret diary where you write your password. Python reads it quietly but doesn’t show it to the world.


**3. Web App Title**
st.header("CSV_Excel_QA_Chatbot")

Shows a big heading on your webpage:
“CSV_Excel_QA_Chatbot.”
Example: Like a page title in Microsoft Word.
