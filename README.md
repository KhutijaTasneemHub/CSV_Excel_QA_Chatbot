**Code Explanation – Line by Line**
Written by author – @KhutijaTasneemHub

1. **Importing Libraries (the tools we need)**
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

**pandas (pd):**
Helps read and work with CSV/Excel files (like a spreadsheet in Python).
Example: If you upload a marksheet, pandas lets Python read it row by row.

**streamlit (st):**
Turns this Python program into a simple web app.
Example: Instead of running code in a black terminal, Streamlit shows you a webpage where you can upload files, type questions, and see results.

**from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**

**What it does:** Breaks large text into smaller “chunks.”
**Why:** AI can’t process the whole file at once, so we give it bite-sized pieces.
**Example:** If your Excel has 1000 rows, we split them into smaller groups of 100 rows each so AI doesn’t get overwhelmed.

**from langchain_community.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings**
Embeddings = “text to numbers.”
OpenAI turns each word/sentence into a mathematical fingerprint.
This makes it possible for the computer to compare meanings.
Example: “Car” and “Vehicle” will have similar embeddings (close numbers), even though the words are different.

**from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS**
FAISS is a search engine for embeddings.
Think of it as Google inside your Excel/CSV – but instead of exact words, it searches by meaning.
Example: If your Excel has “Doctor,” and you search for “Physician,” FAISS will still find it.

**from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOpenAI**

ChatOpenAI: Lets your program talk to ChatGPT models inside Python.
load_qa_chain: A ready-made pipeline that takes:
Your question
The relevant parts of your file
Feeds it to AI
Returns an answer.

**2. Setting Up OpenAI API Key**
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

**What it does:**
Loads your secret API key from a hidden .env file.
Keeps your password safe so it’s not visible on GitHub.
Example: Think of .env as a secret diary where you write your password. Python reads it quietly but doesn’t show it to the world.


**3. Web App Title**
st.header("CSV_Excel_QA_Chatbot")

Shows a big heading on your webpage:
“CSV_Excel_QA_Chatbot.”
Example: Like a page title in Microsoft Word.

**4. Upload CSV/Excel File**
file = st.file_uploader("Upload your CSV or Excel file", type=["csv", "xlsx"])

Shows a file upload box on the web page.
Lets the user upload CSV or Excel files.
Example: Like when Gmail asks you to “attach a file.”

**5. Read the Uploaded File**
if file is not None:
    if file.name.endswith(".csv"):
        df = pd.read_csv(file)
    else:
        df = pd.read_excel(file)

What it does:
Checks if a file is uploaded.
If it’s a CSV → reads it using read_csv.
If it’s an Excel → reads it using read_excel.
Example: If you upload sales.csv, pandas will open it like Excel and show rows & columns in Python.

**6. Convert Data into Text**
data_text = df.to_string(index=False)
Turns the whole table (rows & columns) into plain text.

This text is what AI will later understand.
Example: Your Excel sheet “Name, Age, City” becomes:

Alice 24 New York
Bob 30 London

**7. Split Text into Chunks**
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    separators=["\n"],
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=50,
    length_function=len
)
chunks = text_splitter.split_text(data_text)

Breaks the text into small paragraphs (chunks).
chunk_size=500: Each chunk max 500 characters.
chunk_overlap=50: Last 50 characters are repeated in the next chunk (so no sentence is cut halfway).

Example:
Original: “Apples are red. Bananas are yellow.”
If cut in the middle → AI may lose meaning.
Overlap ensures context continues smoothly.

**8. Create Embeddings + Store in FAISS**
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(chunks, embeddings)


Step 1: Convert each chunk into embeddings (numbers).
Step 2: Store them in FAISS (a database for fast search).
Example:
Upload a sheet of 100 student names → each name is turned into numbers → FAISS keeps them ready to search.

**9. Take User Question**
user_question = st.text_input("Ask a question about your data:")

Shows a text box for the user to type a question.
Example: If your Excel is about sales, you can ask:
“Which city has the highest sales?”

**10. Find Relevant Chunks**
similar_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(user_question)
Searches FAISS for chunks related to the question.

Example: If you ask “Top sales city,” FAISS finds the row where “Sales” and “City” appear.

**11. Load AI Model**
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    temperature=0,
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"
)


Uses GPT-3.5-Turbo model.
temperature=0: AI gives factual answers, not creative stories.
Example: Instead of making up answers, it sticks to what’s in your file.

**12. Create a Question-Answering Chain**
chain = load_qa_chain(llm, chain_type="stuff")
Makes a pipeline that:
Takes your question
Finds matching file text
Sends both to AI
Returns an answer.

**13. Generate Answer**
answer = chain.run(input_documents=similar_docs, question=user_question)
st.write("### Answer:")
st.write(answer)
Runs the chain, gets the AI’s answer, and shows it on the web page.
Example:
You ask: “Which city has max sales?”
AI looks into your Excel → finds “London = $5000” → replies:
“The city with highest sales is London with $5000.”
